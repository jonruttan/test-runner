# Design

## Goals

- Lightweight: a small testing framework that can live in a single header.
- Portable: minimal assumptions about OS/toolchain.
- Simple: straightforward macros and output suitable for small C projects.

## Non-goals

- A full-featured unit testing ecosystem (fixtures, mocking frameworks, rich reporters).
- Heavy dependencies or generated code.
